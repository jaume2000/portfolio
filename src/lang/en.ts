`My name is Jaume Ivars Grimalt, I was born in October 2001 here in Alicante, Spain, so I am currently 21 years old. Curently I am currently living in Valencia, I moved on to study a degree in Computer Engineering and loved the city. I am passionate about the world of entrepreneurship, which has led me to be self-taught and to lead small teams in personal projects.
I have 4 years of experience in Unity3D and its language C#. I have also learned c and c++ in competitive programming clubs. I learned on my own JavaScript, HTML and CSS to later learn TypeScript, React, NextJS and other libraries such as Express, D3, ThreeJS, etc. I also had the chance to learn databases and cloud services (Firebase, MongoDB, AWS S3, Google Cloud Buckets) and API creation.
Because I have specialized in computer science (algorithms, AI, etc.) I have learned a lot of Python (pytorch, keras, tensowflow, numpy, matplotlib, ...).
I have always been bilingual, speaking Spanish and Catalan and I use English every day for leisure and work. I am currently in the process of learning French.`,
